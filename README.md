 # Banking Dataset- Marketing Targets Machine Learning Project 
 
 This project involves building a machine learning model to identify potential marketing targets for a
 bank based on customer data. The goal is to predict whether a customer will respond positively to a
 marketing campaign. 
 
 This model compares the scores with two different approaches to train the model i.e: 
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Logistic Regression
